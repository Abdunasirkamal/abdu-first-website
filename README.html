🚀 Project Name (e.g., Real-Time Collaborative Task Manager)
Overview
This project is a fully-responsive, full-stack web application designed to demonstrate robust backend architecture, reactive frontend design, and secure database interactions. It solves the common problem of [Briefly state the problem your app solves, e.g., real-time team synchronization or efficient data visualization].
It was built from scratch to showcase proficiency across the entire web development spectrum.
✨ Key Features & Functionality
 * Authentication & Authorization: Secure user registration, login (using JWT/Sessions), and role-based access control.
 * Real-Time Data Sync: Implemented via [WebSockets or Firestore listeners] for instant updates across all clients.
 * API Design: A clean, RESTful (or GraphQL) API for all data operations, protected by middleware.
 * Data Persistence: Efficiently structured data model supporting [mention key data relationships, e.g., one-to-many task/user relationships].
 * Responsive UI: Seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (using [Tailwind CSS or similar]).
 * [Add a unique feature here, e.g., Integrated search/filtering, AI-powered summaries, or Stripe integration].

💻 Local Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project running on your machine.
Prerequisites
You need the following software installed:
 * Node.js (v18+)
 * npm or yarn
 * A running [Database Name] instance
Backend Setup
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git)
cd repo-name/server

 * Install dependencies:
   npm install
# or yarn install

 * Configure environment variables:
   Create a file named .env in the server directory and populate it:
   PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=a_strong_secret_key

 * Run the server:
   npm run dev

Frontend Setup
 * Navigate to the client directory:
   cd ../client

 * Install dependencies:
   npm install

 * Configure API URL:
   Update the environment variable in the client/.env file to point to your local server:
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api

 * Start the client application:
   npm run start

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
